# Tilemap

Just a repo where I play around with canvas, drawings, noise generation and some other stuff.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate `dist/<entrypoint>.html` and `dist/<entrypoint>.js` for every
entrypoint in `src/entries`. New entries are added manually via `webpack.config.js`.
